XML I/O
================================================================================

The Ionflux Object Base System provides features that allow XML I/O to be 
added to classes that are defined using the class template system. Adding 
XML I/O capability works automatically to a large extent, especially if the 
state of an object that is to be serialized to or from XML consists entirely 
of basic types and objects based on the Ionflux Object Base System.

This document contains notes on how the XML I/O system is implemented in the 
class template system and is intended as a guide to developers who wish to 
extend or modify its functionality.

See class-templates.txt for information on supported properties for class 
configuration and additional documentation for the XML I/O system from the 
user perspective.

Templates
================================================================================

This section describes the templates used to create the XML I/O features for 
a class.

class
  header
    xml
      declare_xml_io_funcs       Declares the XML I/O functions for a 
                                 class:
                                 
                                 getXMLElementName()
                                 getXMLAttributeData()
                                 getXMLChildData()
                                 loadFromXMLFile()
                                 getXMLObjectFactory()
                                 
  impl
    xml
      create_xml_io_funcs_impl   Creates the implementation for the XML I/O 
                                 functions.
      get_xml_property_attribute_value
                                 Creates the attribute value for properties 
                                 that are serialized as XML attributes. The 
                                 value thet is generated must be suitable for 
                                 insertion into a std::ostream using the '<<' 
                                 operator.
      get_xml_property_child_element
                                 Creates the child element XML data for  
                                 properties that are serialized as XML child 
                                 elements.
xml
  conf
    xml_object_factory           This is a template used to create the class 
                                 configuration for the XML object factory 
                                 corresponding to a class.
  xml_get_prop_child_element_name
                                 Get the child element name for a vector or 
                                 map style property.
  xml_scan_base_classes          Scan base classes to check if XML I/O is 
                                 enabled on any of them.
  xml_scan_child_classes         Scan child classes to check if XML I/O is 
                                 enabled on any of them. (This works only on 
                                 child classes that are specified directly in 
                                 the class configuration via the 'childClass' 
                                 option.
  xml_scan_properties            Scan class properties to check if any of 
                                 them are enabled as XML attributes or child 
                                 elements.
