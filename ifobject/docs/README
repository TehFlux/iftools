The Ionflux Object Base System (ifobject) is a small library which provides a 
framework for developing object oriented software in C++. It is intended to be 
the foundation of a modular re-implementation of the Ionflux Tools Class 
Library. New classes based on the framework can be created easily using 
templates and configuration files.

See misc/spec.txt for an overview of features which will be provided by the 
Ionflux Tools Object Base System.
