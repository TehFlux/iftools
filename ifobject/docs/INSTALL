Install
================================================================================

To build the Ionflux Object Base System, the following dependencies must be 
installed on your target system:

• SCons (http://www.scons.org/)
• libsigc++ (http://libsigc.sourceforge.net/)
• pthread
• tinyxml (http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/)

The following dependencies are optional:

• Python >= 3.3
  required for the Python bindings
• Ionflux Template Processor (IFTemplate) (http://iftools.sourceforge.net/)
  required to build the source files from the class configuration
  (see notes)

If you want to use custom configuration for the build process (for 
example, Python and library paths), copy 
site_scons/local_config.py.default to site_scons/local_config.py and 
adjust the settings as required.

Start the build with

  scons

Install with

  scons install prefix=<installation base directory>

where <installation base directory> ist the directory where the 
Ionflux Object Base System should be installed.

 ******************************************************************************
 * WARNING: It is not recommended at this point to install the Ionflux Object *
 * Base System in a system directory, since this is an alpha version under    *
 * development. (No harm should be done even if you decide otherwise, but     *
 * there is no guarantee.)                                                    *

Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The source files for all of the classes of the Ionflux Object Base System can 
be generated from class configuration files using the ifclassgen and iftpl 
tools which are part of Ionflux Template Processor, which in turn is based on 
the Ionflux Object Base System (ifobject). To avoid a circular dependency, 
ifobject can be built from the pre-generated source files that are part of the 
distribution. The build process will skip generating the source files if 
iftpl or ifclassgen are not available.

Care must be taken if libifobject has changed and ifclassgen and iftpl require 
re-linking. In this case, 'scons bootstrap' can be used to rebuild ifobject 
without generating the source files.

Enjoy!
