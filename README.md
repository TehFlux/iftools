### What is it?

This is a collection of libraries that form the foundation for other projects.

Components of IFTools include:

#### IFObject

The Ionflux Object Base System (ifobject) is a small library which provides a 
framework for developing object oriented software in C++. It is intended to be 
the foundation of a modular re-implementation of the Ionflux Tools Class 
Library. New classes based on the framework can be created easily using 
templates and configuration files.

#### IFTemplate

IFTemplate (Ionflux Template Processor) is a template processing 
library. It also provides a generic Node type that can be used for 
specifying input data for the template engine.

#### IFTools

The Ionflux Tools Class Library contains mostly legacy 
code that will be integrated into the Ionflux Object Base System or moved to 
other libraries.

### Using
