Ionflux Value (ifvalue) is a library which provides simple types based on the 
Ionflux Object Base System, and a special type (IFValue) which allows to 
construct arbitrarily complex data objects out of IFObject based types. It 
also features evaluation of expressions and operations with such objects as 
operands.

See misc/spec.txt for an overview of features which will be provided by the 
Ionflux Value library.
