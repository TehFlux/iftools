================================================================================

To build, you need the SCons build system (see http://www.scons.org/) and the
following libraries:

+ MySQL client
+ libbz2
+ PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions)
+ Gtkmm (optional)

If you do not want to build the Ionflux Tools Class Library with Gtkmm 
features, you can specify gtools=no after the build and install commands.

If you want to use custom configuration for the build process (for 
example, Python and library paths), copy 
site_scons/local_config.py.default to site_scons/local_config.py and 
adjust the settings as required.

You can then (on Linux and FreeBSD systems) build everything with:

scons

Type

scons -h

for a list of build options.

To install, type:

scons install

You must be root to install to default locations. If you want to install to a 
different directory, you can specify a prefix with:

scons install prefix=<target directory>

You can also

Have fun!
