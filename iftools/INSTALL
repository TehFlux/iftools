Install
================================================================================

To build, you need the SCons build system (see http://www.scons.org/) and the
following libraries:

+ MySQL client
+ libbz2
+ PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions)
+ Gtkmm (optional)

If you do not want to build the Ionflux Tools Class Library with Gtkmm 
features, you can specify gtools=no after the build and install commands.

You can then (on Linux and FreeBSD systems) build everything with:

scons

or

scons platform=<your platform>

where <your platform> is one of:

linux
freebsd
win32

Type

scons -h

for a list of build options.

The Win32 build script assumes that you have MinGW/Dev-Cpp and the required 
libraries properly installed and configured. Infortunately, this is currently 
not tested very well. Please let me know if you encounter any problems.

To install, type:

scons install

You must be root to install to default locations. If you want to install to a 
different directory, you can specify a prefix with:

scons install prefix=<target directory>

Have fun!
