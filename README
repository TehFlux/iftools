Thank you for your interest in the Ionflux Tools Class Library project!

The Ionflux Tools Class Library is a lightweight multi-platform C++ framework 
designed for rapid development of applications in a client/server 
architecture. It features a set of classes that are essential for most 
projects, but on a higher level and thus not provided directly by the STL 
(C++ Standard Template Library) or system libraries. The Ionflux Tools Class 
Library is released under the GNU General Public License, meaning it is free 
software! (See LICENSE in the distribution for more information.)

Features include:

+ Logging/console output facility.
+ Command line parsing.
+ Configuration file I/O.
+ Database interface.
+ IO multiplexing.
+ Generic, serializable tree data structure.
+ Perl-compatible regular expression pattern matching.
+ String filters.
+ Lightweight template engine.
+ TCP socket API.
+ Advanced date and time handling (not restricted to the POSIX epoch, 
  supporting time zone conversions).
+ Generic string tokenizer.
+ Generic TCP client and server, message based client and server, and 
  authenticated client and server.
+ Miscellaneous helpful and easy to use utility functions.

Furthermore, the following tools are provided with the distribution:

+ ifdate A world clock and datetime conversion utility.
+ iftpl An easy-to-use template processor.
+ ifpasswd An SHA-1 based authentication file generator.

See the SourceForge.net page of the project for releases available for 
download:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/iftools/

You can always get the latest version of the Ionflux Tools Class Library from 
the Subversion repository at:

http://iftools:iftools@xi.ionflux.org/svn/iftools/

To get the Ionflux Tools Class Library from Subversion, you need to have 
Subversion installed (http://subversion.tigris.org/). Then change to a 
directory of your choice (for example iftools) and type:

svn co http://iftools:iftools@xi.ionflux.org/svn/iftools/trunk/

This, however, is a development version, and might possibly be unstable. You 
should not use this unless you want to help with debugging and testing new 
features.

Documentation is available from the official Ionflux Tools Class Library 
Homepage:

http://www.ionflux.org/tools/

If you have already downloaded and unpacked the Ionflux Tools Class Library, 
or have obtained the distribution from Subversion, you can generate the 
documentation from source using Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org/). Just type

doxygen

in the root directory of the distribution.

Ionflux Tools uses the following libraries:

+ PCRE (Perl compatible regular expressions).
+ bzip2
+ mysql
+ Gtkmm (optional)

Ionflux Tools also uses the following external code:

+ Mersenne Twister randomizer class by Richard J. Wagner 
  (rjwagner@writeme.com, 
  http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~wagnerr/MersenneTwister.html); 
  based on code by Makoto Matsumoto, Takuji Nishimura, and Shawn Cokus 
  (matumoto@math.keio.ac.jp, Cokus@math.washington.edu, 
  http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/eindex.html).

+ FIPS-180-1 compliant SHA-1 implementation by Christophe Devine 
  (http://www.cr0.net:8040/code/crypto/sha1/).

Please refer to the extern directory of the distribution for detailed 
information and license.

See INSTALL for installation instructions. Otherwise, just type:

scons
su
scons install

This should do the trick on Linux and FreeBSD systems.

Have fun!
