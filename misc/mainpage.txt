/*! \mainpage The Ionflux Tools Class Library (iftools)

\section intro Introduction

Thank you for your interest in the %Ionflux Tools Class Library project!

The %Ionflux Tools Class Library is a lightweight multi-platform C++ framework designed for rapid development of applications in a client/server architecture. It features a set of useful classes and tools, such as a powerful template engine and a universal hierarchical type. The %Ionflux Tools Class 
Library is released under the GNU General Public License, meaning it is free 
software! (See \c LICENSE in the distribution for more information.)

\section features Features

Features of the %Ionflux Tools Class Library include:

\li Generic, serializable tree data structure.
\li \ref tpldoc, including \ref classtpldoc.
\li Memory management (object pools, reference counting, parent objects).
\li Logging/console output facility.
\li Command line parsing.
\li \ref configdoc.
\li Database interface.
\li IO multiplexing.
\li Perl-compatible regular expression pattern matching.
\li \ref strfiltdoc.
\li \ref datetimedoc (not restricted to the POSIX epoch, 
supporting time zone conversions).
\li Generic byte string tokenizer.
\li TCP socket API.
\li Generic TCP client and server, message based client and server, and 
authenticated client and server.
\li Support for the Cairo vector graphics API (http://www.cairographics.org/).
\li Miscellaneous helpful and easy to use utility functions.

Furthermore, the following tools are provided with the distribution:

\li \ref ifdate A world clock and datetime conversion utility.
\li \ref iftpl An easy-to-use template processor.
\li \ref ifpasswd An SHA-1 based authentication file generator.
\li \ref ifls A template-enabled directory listing utility.

\section download Download

See the SourceForge.net page of the project for releases available for 
download:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/iftools/

You can always get the latest version of the %Ionflux Tools Class Library 
from the Subversion repository at:

https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/iftools/

To get the %Ionflux Tools Class Library from Subversion, you need to have 
Subversion installed (http://subversion.tigris.org/). Then change to a 
directory of your choice (for example \c iftools) and type:

<tt>svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/iftools/trunk/</tt>

This, however, is a development version, and might possibly be unstable. You 
should not use this unless you want to help with debugging and testing new 
features.

\section docs Documentation

Documentation is available from the official %Ionflux Tools Class Library 
Homepage:

http://www.ionflux.org/tools/

If you have already downloaded and unpacked the %Ionflux Tools Class Library, 
or have obtained the distribution from Subversion, you can generate the 
documentation from source using Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org/). Just type

\c doxygen

in the root directory of the distribution.

\section deps Dependencies and contributed code

%Ionflux Tools uses the following libraries:

\li PCRE (Perl compatible regular expressions).
\li bzip2
\li mysql
\li Gtkmm (optional)

%Ionflux Tools also uses the following external code:

\li Mersenne Twister randomizer class by Richard J. Wagner 
(rjwagner@writeme.com, 
http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~wagnerr/MersenneTwister.html); 
based on code by Makoto Matsumoto, Takuji 
Nishimura, and Shawn Cokus (matumoto@math.keio.ac.jp, 
Cokus@math.washington.edu, 
http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/eindex.html).
\li FIPS-180-1 compliant SHA-1 implementation by Christophe Devine 
(http://www.cr0.net:8040/code/crypto/sha1/).

Please refer to the \c extern directory of the distribution for detailed 
information and license.

Please see \c README in the distribution for more information and 
\c INSTALL for installation instructions.

If you find any bugs or want to send a feature request or comments and 
suggestions, please feel free to send a mail to mail@ionflux.org.

\section Tools

This is an overview of the applications included with the distribution.

\subsection ifdate ifdate

\c ifdate is a world clock and datetime utility. It displays the current 
time or various timestamp variants in a specified time zone and output 
format.

\c ifdate supports all the time zones of the world, but does not know 
about all the cities and DST rules of the world (yet). To obtain a list of 
recognized time zone alias names (which you may use with the \c -l option 
of \c ifdate), run \c ifdate with the \c -a or \c --aliases option.

More time zone aliases (city names) and DST rules will be added in the 
future. (If you really miss a certain alias name or DST rule, or if you 
detect a wrong time, please let me know and I will try to fix the problem 
as soon as possible.)

(See also \ref dtapp)

\subsection iftpl iftpl

\c iftpl is a template processor that uses the %Ionflux Tools template 
engine (Ionflux::Tools::Template). See <tt>test/template/test.tpl</tt> and 
<tt>test/conf/template.conf</tt> for an example of how to write templates 
and configuration files. \c iftpl has been used to generate some of the 
classes of %Ionflux Tools. You can also take a look at the templates in the 
\c template directory of the distribution.

For more information, see the \ref tpldoc documentation.

\subsection ifpasswd ifpasswd

\c ifpasswd is a tool to generate password files for the simple 
authentication implemented in Ionflux::Tools::AuthFile. Actually, a line 
generated by \c ifpasswd consists of an username, a separator (':') and 
the SHA-1 hash of the password, encoded as a hexadecimal string. You can 
use \c ifpasswd to generate authentication files for 
Ionflux::Tools::TCPAuthServer.

\subsection ifls ifls

\c ifls is a directory listing utility (similar to \c ls). The output can be 
customized using templates.

You can also check the \c test directory for more tools, such as a generic 
TCP client and server and an echo server.

Have fun!
