class.name = TCPMessageServer
class.shortDesc = Message based TCP server
class.title = Message based TCP server
class.longDesc = A Message based TCP server. This works like a TCPServer, except that \
 * incoming data is unpacked into a message (if possible). Outgoing data is \
 * wrapped into a message and serialized before being sent over the socket.
